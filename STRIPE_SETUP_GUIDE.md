## 🔧 Setup Steps

### 1. **Environment Variables**
Add these to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. **Supabase Setup**
Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:
```bash
# Run setup-products.sql to add your recipe card products
```

### 3. **Stripe Dashboard Setup**
1. Create products in Stripe Dashboard (optional - we're using dynamic pricing)
2. Set up webhook endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Enable these webhook events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`

### 4. **Supabase Storage**
1. Create a bucket called `digital-products`
2. Upload your recipe card PDFs
3. Set up RLS policies for secure access

### 5. **Test the Integration**
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/store` and click "Buy Now" on a product
3. Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Complete the payment and check your Supabase orders table

## 🧪 Testing Checklist
